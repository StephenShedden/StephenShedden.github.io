## Create a repository

Head over to GitHub and create a new public repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
- If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right

## Clone the repository

Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StephenShedden/StephenShedden.github.io
```

## Hello World

Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:

```bash
cd StephenShedden.github.io
echo "Hello World" > index.html
```

## Push it

Add, commit, and push your changes:

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Intial commit"
git push -u origin master #default branch name can might be main
```
## ...and you're done

Fire up a browser and go to https://StephenShedden.github.io
