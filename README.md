   1. Put in some indents and you have 2.1 hit enter.
   2. 2.2 it is like magic.

## List of things I have done here

1. Tryed to secure branch and site best I could.
2. Used the GitHub instructions to get the simple "Hello World" in test message up on GitHub hosted static website.
3. Created a Project space in VS Code, dumped Web site backup in a directory in the project. Ripped out the Sql and PhP components and tested functionality. Copied the files and directories I wanted to the static web site repo, committed changes, and pushed it to GitHub remote repo.
4. One of the pages has a calendar and requires manual changing. This was fun on a headless server. I created a directory were I could just;
    1. Copy the one html file I wanted too
    2. Run the python calendar module
    3. Edit and test the html file with updated days number code block
    4. Put back into web site and test on local machine before pushing to production repo.
    5. Document the workflow and, later, try to automate the majority of the manuel labour.
5. Updated this README.md file.
6. Added Content Security Policy (CSP) to index.html. The directives are set by the Content Security Policy standard, which is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.[CSP policy W3C link](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/)

## List of to dos

1. Clean up code errors and use local Dev tools to improve usability for phones and ipads.
2. Name site and apply accross the site, custom domain name, browser tabs, landing page.
3. Get markdown to work and have my little guides available on my phone.
4. Put my 4 other children names in there somewhere, I love and miss them all.
5. Play around with streaming boxes, other external capabilities, and API resources.

Have a great day!
